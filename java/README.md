# BLINK Preprocessing and Evaluation

This part of the repository contains the Java source code for merging graphs and signature-based algorithms as well as the delta computation for evaluation.

_preprocessing.KGsMergerLinkedGeoData and _preprocessing.KGsMergerSyntheticGraphs can be used to create training files for the evaluation. Places where directory locations have to be changed are marked with //TODO

The mapping package contains the mapping algorithms which are supported by the Signature algorithms in the signatures package.

To evaluate the Delta for mappings created by Blink, the Evaluation class is used. Once again, the location of training and mapping files has to be set at the place marked with //TODO
